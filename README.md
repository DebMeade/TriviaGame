# TriviaGame

This is a world trivia game with a 30 second timer.  If you are not able to complete the game in 30 seconds you will be taken to a screen which shows you how many questions you answered correctly, incorrectly as well as how many were left blank.

You can access the game by going to the following url:
https://debmeade.github.io/TriviaGame/

Once the user opens the link they will have 30 seconds to answer all of the questions on the page.  They will do so by selecting 1 radio button per question.  They can also skip questions if they want to.  Once the timer has reached 30 seconds or clicked the "Done" button at the bottom of the page they will be able to see how they did.  There will be a breakdown of questions answered correctly, incorrectly as well as how many questions were left unanswered.  At this point the user will be able to click the button "Try Again" if they would like to see if they could do better.

This game is built using html, css, javascript and jqery.  

The timer starts and stops using setTimeout and clearTimeout.
